## 💡 What Makes This Different?

Instead of one agent trying to do everything poorly, you get **specialists coordinated by an orchestrator**.

### 🎯 Real Examples

Paste these into your terminal and watch magic happen:

- **"Create a complete investor pitch for OpenSwarm"** → Full deck + executive summary + market research
- **"Research my top 5 competitors and write 3 SEO-optimized blog posts"** → Competitive analysis + keyword research + publish-ready content
- **"Analyze this data and create a quarterly report with charts"** → Data insights + visualizations + formatted document
- **"Generate a product launch video with animations"** → Professional video with graphics and transitions
- **"Build me a marketing campaign for Q2"** → Strategy doc + creative assets + implementation timeline

Connect to 10,000+ external services (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, HubSpot) via Composio for even more power.

## 📦 Get Started in 30 Seconds

**For most users (recommended):**

```bash
npm install -g @vrsen/openswarm
openswarm
```

That's it! The setup wizard handles everything: authentication, dependencies, and configuration.

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+ (Python 3.10+ auto-installed)

## 🔧 Build Your Own Swarm

Fork this repo and create your own specialized AI team in minutes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VRSEN/openswarm.git
cd openswarm
```

Then tell **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, or **Codex**:

> _"Turn this into an SEO optimization swarm"_

They'll automatically customize all agents for your use case.

**Popular custom swarms:**

- **SEO Swarm:** Keyword research + competitor analysis + blog writing
- **Sales Swarm:** Lead research + outreach + proposal generation
- **Marketing Swarm:** Campaign planning + creative assets + analytics
- **Product Swarm:** Market research + feature specs + launch materials

## ⚙️ API Keys & Setup

The setup wizard walks you through everything, but you'll need at least one of these:

**Required (choose one):**

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT-4o and Sora video generation
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude models

**Optional superpowers:**

- `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` - Unlock 10,000+ integrations (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Gemini image generation + Veo video
- `FAL_KEY` - Advanced video editing and effects
- `SEARCH_API_KEY` - Web search for research agent

Tools gracefully degrade when keys are missing — you'll get clear instructions on what to add.
